Problem 1: Use PULP to encode a linear programming problem.
This problem set will involve using a python library called PULP to formulate and solve linear programming problems.

Here is a documentation: https://www.coin-or.org/PuLP/pulp.html Examples are also attached in the tutorial that accompanies this week's reading materials.

As a "warm up" exercise, we are going to use pulp to solve a generic LP of the form

max𝗌.𝗍.𝑐0𝑥0+⋯+𝑐𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1𝑎0,0𝑥0+⋯+𝑎0,𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1⋯𝑎𝑚−1,0𝑥0+⋯+𝑎𝑚−1,𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1≤𝑏0⋮≤𝑏𝑚−1
Note that to make life easier for python programmers we will index starting from 0
. The LP has 𝑛
 decision variables 𝑥0,…,𝑥𝑛−1
, and 𝑚
 constraints.

The data for the problem will be given to you in the form of three lists:

list_c is a list of size n that has the objective coefficients.

list_c: [c0, ..., cn-1]
list_a is a list of 𝑚
 lists where each element of list_a is itself a list of size 𝑛
. This represents all the coefficients.

list_a : [ [ a00, a01, ...., a0,n-1], 
           [ a10, a11, ...., a1,n-1], 
           ...
           [ am-1,0, ...., am-1,n-1] ]
Finally, list_b is a list of size 𝑚
 that has the RHS coefficients of each inequality.

list_b : [ b0,..., bm-1]
Your goal is as follows:

Given list_c, list_a, and list_b, setup the linear programming problem in Pulp,
Solve it and
Return the result. The result is defined by a tuple of three things: (is_feasible, is_bounded, opt_sol).
is_feasible is a Boolean that is True if the LP is feasible and False otherwise.
is_bounded is a Boolean that is True if the LP is bounded and False otherwise. The value of is_bounded is meaningful only if is_feasible is True. If is_feasible is False, this value can be arbitrary.
opt_sol is a list of n values for decision variables 𝑥0,𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑛−1
.
Note that opt_sol is meaningful only if is_feasible and is_bounded are both true. Failing these, the value of opt_sol can be arbitrary.

Problem 2: LP formulation for an investment problem
Welcome to the world of finance! We are interested in investing in a portfolio of various stocks where we wish to maximize the overall return (profit/gain) on the investment but at the same time we do not want our investment to be diversified and the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio to be not too high, etc.. in order to mitigate risk. In this problem, we will develop a portfolio using linear programming.

The total budget available is given to us as an input 𝐵>0
.
We are also given a set of possible stocks and the corresponding data. The data for each investment includes:
Expected return of each investment.
The current price/unit of the stock.
The last earnings/unit of the stock.
The market category of the investment: Commodities, Tech, HealthCare
Your goal is to formulate a linear programming problem for the given data in order to maximize the overall expected return subject to the following constraints:

The total cost of the investment must be less than or equal to 𝐵
.
We are only allowed by buy non-negative (≥0
) amounts of each stock (short selling is not allowed). You can buy fractions of a stock (it is interesting how that works but many online trading houses let you do that).
The investment must be balanced:
The amount invested in each market category should be less than or equal to 2/3rds of the total budget.
The amount invested in each market category should be at least 1/6ths of the total budget.
The price to earnings ratio of the overall portfolio should not exceed 15
.
(A) Formulate on example data.
Suppose we have the following six investments with IDs 1 -6 and the data (this data is purely fictional) as shown below:

ID123456StockIBMMETAAstra-ZenecaPfizerUnileverProcter-GamblePrice/Unit12928672.293852148Expected Return/Unit252031.534.50Earnings/Unit1.98.11.552.55.2CategoryTechTechHealthHealthCommoditiesCommodities
Let 𝑥1,…,𝑥6
 be the decision variables wherein 𝑥𝑖
 is the number of units of stock ID 𝑖
 purchased.

Write down the expression for the objective function in terms of 𝑥1,…,𝑥6
. Also, specify if we are to maximize or minimize it.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Write down the constraint that expresses that the total cost of investment must be less than 𝐵=10,000
.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Write down the constraints that the total investment in each category cannot exceed 2/3rds of the budget. You should write down three constraints one for each category.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Write down the constraints that the total investment in each category must exceed 1/6ths of the budget. You should write down three constraints one for each category.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Write down an expression for the price of the overall portfolio (you have already done so for one of the constraints you expressed above). Also write down an expression for the overall earnings of the portfolio.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

We wish to enforce the constraint that the overall Price/Earnings ratio of the portfolio cannot exceed 15. Write down the constraint as

Price≤15×Earnings

Problem 3: Optimal Transport
Suppose we have piles of different sizes of raw material at various locations in a worksite.

The piles of raw material are given as follows:

ID01𝑛−1Coordinates(𝑥0,𝑦0)(𝑥1,𝑦1)⋮(𝑥𝑛−1,𝑦𝑛−1)Weight𝑊0𝑊1𝑊𝑛−1
We need to plan to redistribute this pile to a new configuration that is also given in terms of the desired coordinates and weights.

ID01𝑚−1Coordinates(𝑥′0,𝑦′0)(𝑥′1,𝑦′1)⋮(𝑥′𝑚−1,𝑦′𝑚−1)Weight𝑊′0𝑊′1𝑊′𝑚−1
ProblemSet-fig-transportation.png

Example
As an example, consider the following data showing the starting configuration:
ID012Coordinates(1,5)(4,1)(5,5)Weight945
We wish to distribute the input pile so that we have the following output:
ID01Coordinates(2,2)(6,6)Weight99
Optimal Transport Problem
The cost of moving 𝑤
 units of material from location (𝑥,𝑦)
 to target location (𝑥′,𝑦′)
 is given by

𝑤×(𝑥−𝑥′)2+(𝑦−𝑦′)2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯√
Our goal is to come up with a transportation plan that minimizes the overall cost of moving raw materials from a starting configuration to an ending configuration.

Example
Going back to our example, here is a transportation plan:

Move 5 units of raw material from (5,5) (location id 2) to (6,6) (target location id 1). This incurs a cost of 5×12+12⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯√=52⎯⎯√
 units.
Move 4 units of raw material from (4,1)
 to (6,6)
. This incurs a cost of 429⎯⎯⎯⎯√
 units.
Move 9 units from (1,5) to (2,2). Cost is 910⎯⎯⎯⎯√
 The total cost of our plan is 52⎯⎯√+429⎯⎯⎯⎯√+910⎯⎯⎯⎯√≈57.072
 units.
The question is whether we can do better than this?

Linear Program Formulation
To evolve a linear programming formulation, first let's identify the decision variables.

Let 𝑥𝑖,𝑗
 denote the amount of material transported from source location 𝑖
 to target location 𝑗
. Since 0≤𝑖≤𝑛−1
 and 0≤𝑗≤𝑚−1
, there are 𝑚×𝑛
 such decision variables.

Clearly 𝑥𝑖,𝑗≥0
 since it does not make any sense to transport negative amount of material.

Let 𝐷𝑖,𝑗
 denote the distance from source location 𝑖
 to destination location 𝑗
.

𝐷𝑖,𝑗=(𝑥𝑖−𝑥′𝑗)2+(𝑦𝑖−𝑦′𝑗)2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯√.
Write down the objective function in terms of 𝑥𝑖,𝑗
 and 𝐷𝑖,𝑗
 for 1≤𝑖≤𝑛
 and 1≤𝑗≤𝑚
. Also indicate if we are going to maximize or minimize it.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Next for each source location 𝑖
, the total amount of material transported from 𝑖
 to various destination locations must sum up to 𝑤𝑖
 : the total weight of material at location 𝑖
. Write down a constraint to enforce this.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Next for each destination location 𝑗
 , the total amount of material transported to 𝑗
 from various source locations must sum up to 𝑤′𝑗
 : the total weight of material at destination location 𝑗
. Write down a constraint to enforce this.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Formulate your optimization problem and return the optimal solution for given problem data:

source_coords: List of (x,y) pairs of coordinates for the source locations.
The size of the list is the number of source locations 𝑛
.
source_weights: List of 𝑤𝑖
 weights for the source location.
The size of the list equals number of source locations 𝑛
 and 𝑖𝑡ℎ
 element of this list is the weight corresponding to the 𝑖𝑡ℎ
 coordinate in the list source_coords.
Similarly we have two lists dest_coords and dest_weights. Note that sum(source_weights) must equal sum(dest_weights).

Your function should return the solution as a list of lists sol wherein sol[i][j] indicates the amount of material transported from source location i to destination location j.

Example
For instance, suppose our solution was as follows (here 𝑛=3,𝑚=4
):
𝑥0,0=0,𝑥0,1=5,𝑥0,2=7,𝑥0,3=0𝑥1,0=1,𝑥1,1=4,𝑥1,2=4,𝑥1,3=4𝑥2,0=4,𝑥2,1=5,𝑥2,2=5,𝑥2,3=5

Problem 3B (Optimal Pricing Model)
Let us consider a variant of the optimal transportation problem where we have the same data including the starting and desired configurations.

Source locations given as coordinates and weights : (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖),𝑤𝑖
, 𝑖=1,…,𝑛
.
Target locations given as coordinates and weights: (𝑥′𝑗,𝑦′𝑗),𝑤′𝑗
, 𝑗=1,…,𝑚
.
The cost of transporting a unit weight from source location 𝑖
 to target location 𝑗
 is given by the Euclidean distance:
𝐷𝑖,𝑗: (𝑥𝑖−𝑥′𝑗)2+(𝑦𝑖−𝑦′𝑗)2⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯√
Instead of deriving the transportation plan, we will focus on setting purchase/sale prices at the source and target locations respectively.

Suppose, we are allowed to set prices at the source and target locations for the material such that at each source location 𝑖
 we set a price 𝑝𝑖
 per unit of the material and at each target location 𝑗
, we set a price 𝑝′𝑗
 per unit of the material. However, we cannot set the prices arbitrarily. We have to follow the following constraint:

For each source location 𝑖
 and target location 𝑗
 the price difference 𝑝′𝑗−𝑝𝑖
 must be less than or equal to 𝐷𝑖,𝑗
.
Although this constraint sounds strange, it can be justified from economic arguments. Imagine for some source 𝑖
 and destination 𝑗
, we have 𝑝′𝑗−𝑝𝑖>𝐷𝑖,𝑗
 (we are making a strictly positive profit). Then a competitor can undercut us by buying at a higher price and/or selling at a lower price and thus take the business away from us. Perhaps, we try to undercut the competitor until finally, we have jointly driven the prices down to satisfy 𝑝′𝑗−𝑝𝑖≤𝐷𝑖,𝑗
.

Once the prices have been setup at the source and target locations, the revenue we earn by transporting goods is given by

∑𝑗=1𝑚𝑝′𝑗𝑤′𝑗−∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑝𝑖𝑤𝑖
The first term is what we get by selling at the target location and the second term is what we get from buying at the source locations.

Formulate a LP that will set prices so that we maximize the revenue while satisfying the "economic" constraint above.

Problem data is same as before:

source_coords: List of (x,y) pairs of coordinates for the source locations.
The size of the list is the number of source locations 𝑛
.
source_weights: List of 𝑤𝑖
 weights for the source location.
The size of the list equals number of source locations 𝑛
 and 𝑖𝑡ℎ
 element of this list is the weight corresponding to the 𝑖𝑡ℎ
 coordinate in the list source_coords.
Similarly we have two lists dest_coords and dest_weights. Note that sum(source_weights) must equal sum(dest_weights).

Your function should return the solution as pair of two lists: (source_prices, target_prices). source_prices should have length n and target_prices should have length m.
